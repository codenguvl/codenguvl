Web Developer
-------------

Initially, I started learning web design, but with a foundation in Information Systems, I delved deeper into the software development process. This has allowed me not only to create visually appealing products but also to ensure they function efficiently and meet customer needs. I am passionate about finding innovative software solutions to address real-world problems.
